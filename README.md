# GMod Workshop Stats
A beautiful program for Mac OS X Yosemite or later (10.10+) for viewing your uploads to the Garry's Mod Workshop.

# Presented to you in a lovely UI
The user interface is beautiful and simplistic because I feel that information should be presented without clutter and disorganization.

# Initial setup
I recommend that you head over to the Preferences (Command+Comma) and set the path to `gmpublish`, which should be in the user's `/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/GarrysMod/bin` folder.

# Build for yourself
Requirements:
-  Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later
-  Xcode 7.0 or later
-  Objective-C knowledge would be beneficial, since I wrote the program entirely in it
-  **Steam and [Garry's Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) must be installed and run at least once**
-  at least 1 published mod would be nice, otherwise this wouldn't be any use to you
-  (I didn't use Cocoapods, homebrew, ant, or any of that)

How to:
  1. Download the repo and extract the contents
  2. Open the **.xcodeproj** file
  3. Build or run
  4. Enjoy :)
