# GMod Workshop Stats
A beautiful program for Mac OS X 10.10+ for viewing your uploads to the Garry's Mod Workshop.

## Presented to you in a lovely UI
The user interface is beautiful and simplistic because I feel that information should be presented without clutter and disorganization.

## Initial setup
I recommend that you head over to the Preferences (Command+Comma) and set the path to `gmpublish`, which should be in the user's `/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/GarrysMod/bin/` folder.

## Build for yourself
1. Make sure Xcode is installed
2. Download the repo as a ZIP or clone the repo
3. Open the project in Xcode and run the project
4. Enjoy!
